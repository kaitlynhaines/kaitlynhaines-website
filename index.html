        <p class="lead mb-4"> I am Kaitlyn Haines. I attend UC Riverside as an undergraduate student in psychology. My educational path has been directed towards the psychological field because I feel that I can truly help people as well as make an impact on their life, starting with their mental health. I do not plan to end my schooling when I graduate with a B.A in psychology. I plan to obtain my masters then go into the career of forensic psychology. This career path has always interested me greatly for as long as I can remember. I believe that with this education I can live out my life to my full potential. 
<br><br>

       When thinking of words to describe my work ethic three instantly come to mind: reliable, determinate, and dedicated. I like to think of myself as a very hardworking individual. I have been a member of the field of employment since I turned 16. I have juggled work and school since the very first moment I was able to. I see my ability to work as a privilege and opportunity. I did not only start working so young for the money, but because I knew that it would help me in the future. Although I do feel I have many strong suits of my work ability, some may argue I do have a weakness. This weakness would be that I can be a slight perfectionist at times. I am a strong believer of putting 100% effort into everything I do, no matter how big or small the task at hand may be. This also causes me to try my hardest to do things right the first time. If I fail to do so I almost always get it right the second time as it is important to learn from previous mistakes. This is also a key factor into utilizing time as efficiently as possible. Efficiency is another very important aspect of the work field for me. I feel that I am able to find a good balance between perfectionism and efficiency. Yes, my need to have everything be perfect does sometimes cause me to spend a little longer on some things than I would originally have liked, however I almost always set a time budget to make sure I am maximizing all the time I am given for whatever it is I am doing. 
<br><br>

I have worked three jobs in the span of 3 years. One was a seasonal Job at Hollister which is why it was short lived. The other was at Chick Fil A where I worked happily for a year until the building was shut down for renovation. This is when I obtained my current job at Target. In all three jobs I strived ( and still do) to do my absolute best. I thoroughly and truthfully enjoyed my time at my previous jobs and my current job. As of now I work around 25-28 hours a week while maintaining my school grades as I attend as a full time student.
